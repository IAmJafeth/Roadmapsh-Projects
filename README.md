# Jafeth's Roadmap.sh Projects

Welcome to my **Roadmap.sh Projects** repository! This serves as the central hub for all the projects I will be working on from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). Each project will be stored as a submodule to maintain independent progress tracking within the Roadmap.sh platform.

## About

[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) is a community-driven resource that provides learning paths and project ideas for developers. I will be following various roadmaps and implementing projects to enhance my skills and track my progress.

## Structure

Each project will have its own repository and will be added to this repository as a **submodule**. This structure allows for:
- Independent version control per project.
- Proper tracking of progress on Roadmap.sh.
- A centralized location to access all projects.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to explore my projects:
1. Clone this repository along with its submodules:
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/IAmJafeth/Roadmapsh-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the repository:
   ```sh
   cd Roadmapsh-Project
   ```
3. To update submodules:
   ```sh
   git submodule update --remote --merge
   ```
